# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a massive project spanning multiple sections marking the culmination of having learned all web development fundamentals in the course. It is an application similar to Yelp but for ranking and reviewing camp sites.

In between sections are additional topics such as middleware, error handling, data validation, authorization and authentication smoothing the edges for a more well-rounded web application that can be found on the main branch of this repository.

While other sections pushed to GitHub take a more Gist approach for academic purposes, YelpCamp has some form of version control where each section can be found in its own branch with its own Git history. The main branch contains all of the merged sections where the complete application can be found.
