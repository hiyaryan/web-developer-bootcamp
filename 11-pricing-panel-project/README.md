- [CodePen](#codepen)
- [CSS Reset](#css-reset)

## [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
CodePen is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. Build and deploy a website, show off your work, build test cases to learn and debug, and find inspiration.

## [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
